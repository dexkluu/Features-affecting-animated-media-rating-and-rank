# Overview and Data
Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into whether customers prefer certain features of anime more than others.

## Tools Used

The analysis was done using R version 3.5.1 in a R markdown file. The output is a pdf after knitting. The libraries used were gridExtra, ggplot2, ggrepel, tidyverse, knitr, and kableExtra.

## Takeaways


## Replicate the analysis

To replicate my results, one could simply knit the R markdown file to pdf. The data is included in the repository. Ensure that all tools and libraries such as R markdown/knitting and the libraries mentioned in the "Tools Used" section are installed and running on your personal device.
